This is a synthesizer project. The goal is to build something like a modular
synthesizer.

Code is in need of a rewrite and an actually usuable user interface
that doesnt require you to memorize the commands to get to different screens,
but currently supports these features:

Additive Synthesis
Subtractive Synthesis
FM Synthesis
Scanned Synthesis
Reverb Unit


I want to give thanks to Adventure Kid
https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/
for compiling this cool set of waveforms that
I use with the scanned synthesis tool.

Good Luck getting this to run on your computer.
I hardcoded screen dimensions and theres no telling
what else will cause problems.

On Ubuntu you will need to:
apt install libx11-dev
